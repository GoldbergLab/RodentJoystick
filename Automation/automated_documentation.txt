Issues that have come up:
Where does it make sense to store contingency information - only in the jstruct?
    Probably not - need it in stats structure as well.
    Jstruct can have contingency information all the time too 
    Store stats info:
How to decide number of days for contingency selection - 1 day in advance

Contingency Format for any Arbitrary Box:
Location - old contingency:
expt_dir\Box_i\Archived\contingency_mm_dd_yyyy_HH_MM.txt

Note that Center Threshold doesn't change- it's there to ensure mouse isn't
starting trial with joystick very far out.
