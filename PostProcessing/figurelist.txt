List of Plots
make_plots.m - hist interval
	Nosepoke Joystick Onset Distribution (1)
	Nosepoke Touch Post Onset Distribution (1)
	Hold Length Distribution (1)
	Hold Length Within Threshold Distribution (1) - threshold
generate_time_distr.m - hist interval
	Time (Activity/Reward) Distribution (1) - works with multiple days

	Joystick Reward Onset Distribution (1) - 
js_touch_dist.m
	Magnitude Distribution (1)
find_sector.m
	Activity Color Map (1) - won't work with multiple days (requires separate plot per day)
	Angle Distribution (Linear) (1) - Reward Rate, Threshold - won't work well with multiple days (too much data) - separate plot per day
trajectory_analysis.m - windows, start, end

	Trajectory Magnitude Analysis (4) - link block


TrajectoryAnalysis\trajectory_analysis
TrajectoryAnalysis\find_sector
TimeDistributions\generate_time_distr
TimeDistributions\hold_time_distr
make_plots -> probably split up into separate functions'
	np_js_distribution
	np_post_distribution
	JS hold time onset distribution
	JS hold time onset distribution with threshold
make_pdfplots -> also do the same 
	something to do with velocity distributions, ask teja
	



GUI Architecture
Seems very difficult to implement multi day stuff by saving and merging single figures 
- almost all sources recommend saving the data
and plotting again - consider possibly archiving data, so the only step is to plot?
but for more complicated figures (especiall trajectory_analysis), likelihood of recomputing data increases, 
so no reason to actually cache - not really much advantage since for longer computations, more arguments/variability anyways
caching works well for all except trajectory analysis - maybe 


So have two GUI options - single day/multi day
single day plots:
np_js_distribution
np_post_distribution
(both)
generate_time_distr
trajectory_analysis
find_sector - angle sector information
hold_time_distr (3) - 
    js_hold time onset distributions
    rewarded trajectory rate 
    hold_time_distr
    mean, median, stdev 
onset to reward time (hold_time_distr)
make_pdfplots - same size as trajectory analysis

multi_day_plots:
multi_time_distr (multiple subplots) - single column
np_js_distribution - single plot
np_post_distribution - single plot
js hold time onset distribution (both) - single plot

Use cases:
Select single/multi day
Single Day:
Select group of plots, with control box displaying how they will be formatted
	some options will gray out when no longer available
Select day - plots all, changin day changes plots as soon as a new one is selected

Multiple Days:
Select group of plots, with control box displaying format
some options will gray out when no longer available
Select a series of days, add to plotting group
Only plot when new button is selected
