# RodentJoystick
MATLAB scripts and processing files for analyzing data from rodent joystick experiments

This repository contains MATLAB files for intial processing of data files as well as running data analysis to quantify the mice's behavior. For more information about the experiment, see http://www.nbb.cornell.edu/goldberg/rodentresearch.html.
Most data analysis files are in PostProcessing. For information about how the software as a whole works, see the wiki.
